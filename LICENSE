Polyform Noncommercial License 1.0.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Małgorzata Gendłek

Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
software to do everything you might do with the software
that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright
in it for any permitted purpose.  However, you may
only distribute the software according to the Noncommercial
License and you may not sublicense the software.  This
license does not transfer any ownership in the software,
copyright or patent.

Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software
that covers patent claims the licensor can license,
or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by
using the software.

Noncommercial Purposes

Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.

You may make commercial use of the software only by buying
a separate commercial license from the licensor.

Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
with the software.  You must ensure that you do not remove any
of these notices.

No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply any
other licenses.

No Trademark License

This license does not grant you any right in the trademarks,
service marks, brand names or logos of the licensor.

Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software ends immediately.  If your company makes such
a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf
of your company.

Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32
days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses end
immediately.

No Liability

**As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.**
